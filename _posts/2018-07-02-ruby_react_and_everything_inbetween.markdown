Looking back on the months spent down this journey, and i can't believe this was the final frontier. I've learned so much, and looking back on where i began, i can say that i've learned more at my time here then i would say I learned at 5 years in college. But enough about the journey, let's talk about what i built.

I'm pretty big into beer, but i always find myself traveling to different cities and states needing to google and look up local places to check out, so i thought it'd be fun to build something for myself. This app utelizes the beer mapping API that allows me to plug in my state or city and get instant results on local breweries and/or bars. I have an upcoming trip to denver, co for a concert and the beer culture there is huge. Every corner is another brewery, so this will let me take a look at where i am in denver, and what places i can visit. The app allows for individual users, and allows those users to favorite any of the bars or breweries that come up. 

Doesn't sound too complex, should be easy right? WELL THINK AGAIN.

Creating a rails backend API? No problem, how about a React-Redux front end? I got it. Now how about creating those two and having them integrate with one another? .......Yea, that's essentially where the journey began. 

Problem after problem, i got stuck over and over again, continously hitting walls. How do i authenticate users without a session? How do i render a different navigation bar for users and guests? How do i properly use the lifecycles of a component to render and change components based on prop and state change?!

Honestly, there were times i thought the task was too large, but looking back, i can say i learned more in this project than in any other before it. I learned about Authentications and Authorizations using JWT tokens. I learned about persisting data with React utelizing Local Storage. I learned all about the component life cycles and how they can be used to change components at just the right time. Not to mention brushing up on the little things like React Router and all that middleware inbetween. Now that this is over, its up to me, to continue my education and be the best i can be. Thanks for the ride FlatIron, it's been real.
