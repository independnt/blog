It's been a long while since my first post, and more than a few things have happened since then. I'm at the end of the road for the ruby portion of the program and i'd be remiss if i didnt mention the difficult days behind me, and the even more difficult days that i'm sure lay ahead. 

Since my first post i've gone through HTML and CSS, (which i plan to go through codeacademy to brush up on and improve. I'm looking at you future me.) learned about Git and Github (still trying to perfect my knowledge, pretty confusing at first), and gone through procedural and OO ruby. Not as fast as i had hoped, but progress is progress and as they say, better late than never. 

OO Ruby was a difficult concept for me to grasp, especially when incorperating relationships among multiple classes. When someone asks me about my experience with Ruby, one thing in particular will stick out in my mind. **Collaborating. Objects. Lab.** This lab is one of those tests that made me question if i had what it took to do this. If i could grasp programming and overcome an obstacle that i felt i didnt even know how to approach. I felt like i was trying to build a table with a spoon. But after several, SEVERAL hours, i was finally able to not only continue, but even find afterwards that i understood and grassped the material. I found myself recalling methods and concepts i didnt even knew i remembered. 

I've not only been learning to code, but also learning a moral lesson. No matter how tired, how hopeless, or how lost you may seem, push forward, keep trying, and persevere. Now, at the precipice of my CLI Data Gem project, this lesson is more important than ever.

Never forget, "Your practice, will **never** betray you."
