I'm not very sure where to begin. Perhaps that's the reason that i decided to learn software developement in the first place. The absence of certainty. The very fact that, well, i didnt know where to begin.

I'm married to a nurse, my best friend is an architect, and i know three accountants. Each person with their own craft which they can build upon in one way or another. 

And then there's me. Recently 30 and all too often questioning the direction in which my professional life would take me. Too comfortable in a job that wasn't challenging me, or contributing to my professional growth. The worst part? I loved that job. And if i'm being honest, i could've stayed there forever. Working side by side with friends whom i could consider family at this point. But at the end of the day, i was lost. 

They say you'll never work a day in your life if you follow your passion. Now, i won't sit here and claim that coding is my passion in life, but it sparked an interest in me that wasn't there before. It made me curious, frustrated, and when i was finally able to pass tests that had been taunting me for 2 hours? Excited. Software developement is something that scares me, because, well, it's hard. It consistently makes me uncomfortable, because of how unsure it makes me. But i relish in the challenge, because I want this to be my craft. 

I'm married to a nurse, my best friend is an architect, and i know three accountants. And me? I'm going to be a software engineer.
