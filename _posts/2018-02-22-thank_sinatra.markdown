What has two thumbs, and just finished his sinatra project? This guy. Right from the get go, i felt like i had a good grasp on how Sinatra and Active Record could help me get from point A to point B, and i was much more confident going into this project then i was was the CLI project. I guess it just goes to show that practice makes......better, definitely better. 

I created a web app that kept track of a games library. I'm an avid gamer and have been collecting for my entire life, so i've had quite a large library open up. Keep in mind, a lot of these are on different platforms, so my app allows a user to add, edit, or delete games from their library. Each game belongs to a different console (Xbox, playstation, nintendo, iphone, ect.) and consoles belong to the user. 

All in all, its a pretty simplistic and straight forward application, however, a large majority of my time was spent making sure that the app works without error and that there can be no duplication, or invalid users added. You cant sign in if you're already a user, you can't enter games without a name or associated console, you also cannot create consoles that already exist! Most of the time was spent fine tuning and just making sure the proper flash messages came up to inform the user of what's happening. I still set up a 1:1 so that i can review my code to try and improve/refactor it if neccessary, as we know, code can always be improved and condensed!

And now, onward!
