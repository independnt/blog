I cant believe it.

I'm sitting here and i'm so utterly content with myself, it's almost disgusting. Almost as if three days ago, i was a completely different person. Unsure, confused, and feeling completely and utterly outclassed by the task presented before me.

"Build a CLI Data Gem?...Without any tests to guide me?....but...but where do i start?.......Is this even legal?....".

After hours of watching videos, reading articles and hearing Avi's voice in my head stating "there's nothing more intimidating as a developer than this, a blank page" and man was he right. I felt like i was face to face with a bear with nothing but a spoon to protect me. But slowly that spoon turned into a fork, and then into a knife, and now a full blown Sword....metaphorically of course.

Learning about setting up my enviornment, adding all my dependencies, and slowly creating my objects via scraping was no easy task, but i felt myself moving inch by inch, every hour one step closer to my goal. But I cannot speak enough to how helpful the CLI gem walkthrough was. Mainly because of the way Avi presented the building of a concept. Before i had even written any code, i was already thinking about the different ways i could create my objects and add their attributes, or how many classes i was going to have. Was my scraper going to be a class of it's own? All of these thoughts and more were shooting out of my head in every direction possible, and all the while making me more and more anxious about the journey ahead. But after watching that video, i learned that you just need to start building.

Don't worry about what it looks like now, or what your methods are called, or even what classes you'll use. Just.....start! Error after error, method after method, my project slowly began to take shape until i looked up and found that my classes were all collaborating together to create my desired outcome and it felt incredible. 

So now i find myself once again moving forward. A little bit stronger, a little bit more knowledgable, but a ton more confident. 

Until next time, adios!
